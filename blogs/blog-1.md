# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript provides two powerful features—**Union Types** and **Intersection Types**—that helps make code more flexible and type-safe. Let’s explore both and understand why they are so important.

## Union Types

A **Union Type** allows a variable to hold multiple types. It’s useful needed a variable to accept either one type or another.

### Example of Union Type:
```typescript
function printValue(value: string | number) {
  console.log(value);
}

printValue("Hello");  // Output: Hello
printValue(42);       // Output: 42
```

In this example, `value` can be either a `string` or a `number`. TypeScript ensures users by not passing any other data types.

## Intersection Types

An **Intersection Type** combines multiple types into one. It makes an object that must have properties from all the types it combines.

### Example of Intersection Type:
```typescript
interface Employee {
  name: string;
  position: string;
}

interface Manager {
  department: string;
}

type EmployeeManager = Employee & Manager;

const empManager: EmployeeManager = {
  name: "Alice",
  position: "Developer",
  department: "Engineering"
};

console.log(empManager);
```

In Here, `EmployeeManager` is an intersection of both `Employee` and `Manager` types, requiring the object to have all their properties.

## Why Are They Important?

1. **Union Types** allow flexibility by letting user passing multiple types, while still ensuring type safety.
2. **Intersection Types** allows combining multiple types into one, which is useful when working with more complex data.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Union Types**: Useful for handling multiple input types, like an email or a phone number.
- **Intersection Types**: Perfect for representing an entity that combines multiple roles, like a `DeveloperManager`.

## Conclusion

Both **Union** and **Intersection Types** enhance TypeScript by providing flexibility and safety. By using them, we can handle multiple types and combine them in meaningful ways, making our code both robust and easier to maintain.
