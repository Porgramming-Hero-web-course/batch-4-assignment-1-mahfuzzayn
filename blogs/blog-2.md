# How to handle asynchronous operations `async/await` using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript.

Asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or reading files, are a common requirement in modern applications. `async/await` provides a more readable and concise way to handle these operations.

## 1. Callback Functions

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed once the asynchronous task completes. However, callbacks often lead to "callback hell"â€”a situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks, making the code harder to read and maintain.

### Example with Callback:
```typescript
function fetchData(callback: (data: string) => void): void {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Data fetched successfully!";
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log(data);  // Output: Data fetched successfully!
});
```

While this code works, the code can quickly difficult to manage when there are multiple asynchronous operations.

## 2. Promises

Promises were introduced to avoid the losses of callbacks and to make handling asynchronous code more manageable. A `Promise` represents a value that might not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future.

### Example with Promise:
```typescript
function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Data fetched successfully!";
      resolve(data);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);  // Output: Data fetched successfully!
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Though this code is cleaner than callbacks, chaining multiple `.then()` calls can lead to complex and hard-to-read code.

## 3. `async/await`

`async/await` was introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) and simplifies working with asynchronous code by making it look and behave more like synchronous code. `async` is used to declare a function as asynchronous, and `await` pauses the function execution until the Promise is resolved.

### Example with `async/await`:
```typescript
async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Data fetched successfully!";
      resolve(data);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function displayData(): Promise<void> {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);  // Output: Data fetched successfully!
}

displayData();
```

With `async/await`, the code is easier to read, and it doesn't need to use `.then()` for chaining. The function `await fetchData()` pauses execution until the `fetchData` Promise is resolved, making the code flow more like synchronous code.

## Conclusion

- **Callbacks** work but can result in complex, nested code.
- **Promises** help improve readability over callbacks but can still result in chained `.then()` calls.
- **`async/await`** offers the cleanest solution, turning asynchronous code into something that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it more readable and easier to maintain.

Using `async/await` in TypeScript provides better control over asynchronous operations, and it simplifies error handling with `try/catch` blocks, making it the easy to code for managing async tasks.
